  - `created_at`: Timestamp of user registration

- **Property**
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each property
  - `owner_id`: Reference to the user who owns/listed the property
  - `title`: Property name or title
  - `description`: Detailed property description
  - `location`: Address or location details
  - `price_per_night`: Cost for a single night’s booking
  - `created_at`: Timestamp when the property was listed

- **Booking**
  - `id`: Unique booking identifier
  - `user_id`: Reference to the user who made the booking
  - `property_id`: Reference to the booked property
  - `check_in`: Date/time for check-in
  - `check_out`: Date/time for check-out
  - `status`: Booking status (e.g., confirmed, cancelled)

- **Payment**
  - `id`: Unique payment transaction identifier
  - `booking_id`: Reference to the booking being paid for
  - `amount`: Total payment amount
  - `payment_method`: Method used (e.g., card, PayPal)
  - `status`: Payment status (e.g., successful, failed)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp of the transaction

- **Review**
  - `id`: Unique review identifier
  - `user_id`: Reference to the user leaving the review
  - `property_id`: Reference to the property being reviewed
  - `rating`: Numerical rating value

## Feature Breakdown

Below are the core features supported by the backend for the Airbnb Clone project. Each feature is designed to reflect real-world use cases and deliver a robust booking experience.

### User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. Users can sign up, log in securely, update their information, and manage their accounts, forming the foundation for all interactions on the platform.

### Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings. This feature ensures that property information, such as descriptions, pricing, and availability, is always up to date and discoverable by potential guests.

### Booking System
Allows users to make, update, and manage reservations for available properties. The system tracks booking dates, ensures properties aren’t double-booked, and provides hosts and guests with up-to-date booking statuses.

### Payment Processing
Facilitates secure handling of payments for property bookings. Integrates with payment gateways, tracks transaction statuses, and maintains a record of all financial operations for both guests and hosts.

### Review System
Lets users leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed at. This feature builds trust in the platform, helps future guests make informed choices, and gives hosts valuable feedback on their listings.

### API Documentation
All backend endpoints are documented using OpenAPI standards and GraphQL schemas. This makes integration, testing, and future maintenance straightforward for developers and third-party partners.

> These features work together to provide a seamless, secure, and transparent experience for users and hosts, closely modeling the core workflows of leading booking platforms.
## API Security

Security is a core requirement for any platform that handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, and personal communications. This backend implements multiple security layers to protect users, hosts, and platform integrity.

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication:**  
  Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. Implements secure login and session management using hashed passwords and token-based authentication to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Authorization:**  
  Controls what each user can do based on their identity and role (guest, host, admin). Only resource owners or privileged users can modify, delete, or access specific data, preventing misuse and data leaks.

- **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  
  All data received from users is validated and sanitized to prevent attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other forms of malicious input.

- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a set timeframe. This defends against brute-force attacks and abuse of the API, ensuring stable performance for all users.

- **HTTPS Enforcement:**  
  The platform is designed to run over HTTPS, encrypting all data in transit between clients and the server, protecting sensitive information from interception.

- **Audit Logging:**  
  Key actions (such as login attempts, booking changes, and payments) are logged to enable monitoring, alerting, and forensic analysis in the event of suspicious activity.

### Why Security Matters

- **Protecting User Data:**  
  Users trust the platform with their personal and financial information. Robust security prevents data breaches and builds confidence in the service.

- **Securing Payments:**  
  All payment transactions must be secure to prevent fraud, unauthorized charges, and loss of funds for both guests and hosts.

- **Preventing Abuse:**  
  Security measures such as authorization and rate limiting ensure that platform features cannot be misused by attackers or abusive users.

- **Compliance:**  
  Implementing strong security aligns with industry standards and legal requirements (such as GDPR or PCI DSS), supporting future scalability and trust.
