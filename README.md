# Airbnb Clone Backend

This project is a backend implementation of a booking platform inspired by Airbnb. Built with Django, MySQL, and GraphQL, it aims to demonstrate skills in backend architecture, API design, security, and DevOps practices.

## About Me

I developed this project as part of my ALX ProDev Backend training to deepen my skills in production-grade backend engineering. My focus has been on building systems that are secure, maintainable, and ready for real-world collaboration.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate the key features and workflows of a modern booking platform. The backend supports user authentication, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews, all managed through robust APIs and a relational database. Along the way, I’ve prioritized best practices in security, documentation, and automation.

## Project Goals

- Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs for all major platform features
- Design and optimize a relational database using MySQL
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization
- Use Docker for local development and deployment consistency
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Document all architecture, design choices, and APIs for clarity and maintainability

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** Python web framework for scalable API development
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system
- **GraphQL:** Flexible API query language for advanced data access
- **Docker:** Containerization for reproducible environments
- **GitHub Actions:** Automation for testing and deployment
