# Airbnb Clone Backend

This project is a backend implementation of a booking platform inspired by Airbnb. Built with Django, MySQL, and GraphQL, it aims to demonstrate skills in backend architecture, API design, security, and DevOps practices.

## About Me

I developed this project as part of my ALX ProDev Backend training to deepen my skills in production-grade backend engineering. My focus has been on building systems that are secure, maintainable, and ready for real-world collaboration.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to simulate the key features and workflows of a modern booking platform. The backend supports user authentication, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews, all managed through robust APIs and a relational database. Along the way, I’ve prioritized best practices in security, documentation, and automation.

## Project Goals

- Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs for all major platform features
- Design and optimize a relational database using MySQL
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization
- Use Docker for local development and deployment consistency
- Set up CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- Document all architecture, design choices, and APIs for clarity and maintainability

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** Python web framework for scalable API development
- **MySQL:** Relational database management system
- **GraphQL:** Flexible API query language for advanced data access
- **Docker:** Containerization for reproducible environments
- **GitHub Actions:** Automation for testing and deployment

## Team Roles

Developing a scalable backend system requires clear responsibilities across several key roles. Below are the primary roles that contribute to the success of this Airbnb Clone backend project:

### Backend Developer
Designs, implements, and maintains the server-side logic, APIs, and business processes. Responsible for integrating external services, handling data processing, and ensuring code quality and security.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the design, optimization, and maintenance of the project’s database. Responsible for data integrity, backup strategies, performance tuning, and supporting efficient, secure data access.

### DevOps Engineer
Handles the automation, deployment, and monitoring of backend services. Sets up containerization (e.g., Docker), configures CI/CD pipelines (such as GitHub Actions), and ensures high availability, scalability, and reliable operations.

### QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Plans and executes test cases to verify the correctness and reliability of the backend. Develops automated tests, performs manual checks where needed, documents bugs, and collaborates closely with developers to deliver robust features.

### Security Specialist (or Security Champion)
Focuses on identifying and addressing security risks within the application. Implements authentication, authorization, data protection, and best practices for secure coding and compliance.

### Project Manager (optional or combined role)
Coordinates the overall project, sets timelines, manages team communication, and ensures the delivery of milestones. Tracks progress, facilitates meetings, and helps resolve obstacles throughout the project lifecycle.

> On smaller teams (or in learning environments), one person may cover several of these roles. This project simulates real-world responsibilities to encourage best practices and collaboration.
